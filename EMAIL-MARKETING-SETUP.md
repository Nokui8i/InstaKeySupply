# Email Marketing System Setup

## Overview
Your promo popup now collects email addresses and phone numbers for future email marketing campaigns. All collected data is stored securely in Firebase Firestore.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Email Collection System
- **API Route**: `/api/collect-email` - Stores subscriber data
- **Collections**: 
  - `emailSubscribers` - Detailed subscriber information
  - `marketingEmails` - Simplified email list for campaigns
  - `emailCampaigns` - Campaign history and results

### 2. Admin Interface
- **Email Subscribers** (`/admin/email-subscribers`) - View and manage subscribers
- **Email Campaigns** (`/admin/email-campaigns`) - Send promotional emails

### 3. Data Structure
Each subscriber record includes:
```javascript
{
  email: "user@example.com",
  phone: "+1234567890", // optional
  source: "promo_modal", // where they signed up
  subscribed: true,
  emailMarketing: true,
  smsMarketing: false, // if phone provided
  createdAt: timestamp,
  campaign: "promo_modal_10_percent_off",
  consentGiven: true,
  // ... additional metadata
}
```

## Setup Requirements

### 1. Environment Variables
Add these to your `.env.local`:
```bash
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
```

### 2. Email Service Setup
For Gmail:
1. Enable 2-factor authentication
2. Generate an "App Password"
3. Use the app password in `EMAIL_PASS`

For other services (SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.):
- Update the transporter configuration in `/api/send-promo-email/route.ts`
